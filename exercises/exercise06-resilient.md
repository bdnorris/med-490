## Resilient Web Design

I'm asking you to read the following "book": Â [resilientwebdesign.com](https://resilientwebdesign.com/)

If you scroll down, you'll see it's available in the browser, as a PDF, in e-book formats, and even as a podcast. I don't care how you read it, but I want you to read the whole thing. I also want you to write a bit about it.

Why this book? The most important is that it is written by a real web design veteran who can provide a lot of context for where the web has been and where it's headed. I think this kind of context is really important in an industry that is constantly moving forwards, and rarely looking back. Personally, I just hope this reading convinces you, that just as you learn about the history of art and graphic design, the history of the web matters too.

It's pretty opinionated by the end, and talks a lot about a concept called "progressive enhancement". This is a philosophy that is often easy to talk about, but sometimes hard to pull off. I'll mention some of these gotchas, but the core principle is sound.

Please read it, and write up a list of at least six new things you learned. At least one full sentence for each. <!-- A more thoughtful response will likely get you some extra credit.--> Submit to me in a reasonable document format through Slack (rtf, doc, docx, pdf, etc.)

## What is Code?

This one is not required&mdash;100% extra credit. It is written by a programmer for Bloomberg. The audience is a typical business person, and it's very much focused on programming, not web design. But it gives such a great state of the industry on software development that I think it's worth a read.

Simply do the same thing, list 6 things you learned from this, in full sentences and submit as a document to me via Slack.
