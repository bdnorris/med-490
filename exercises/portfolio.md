# Class "Portfolio"

I'd like you to collect all of your projects for the class, organize them, and place the on the server. This includes final PNGs, and PDFs or your work, including text files. 

I do not need your working files, but if you wish to include them, that is fine. I also do not need research or sketches for this.

## Why?

A lot of these projects are evolving, or are very new. Having your finals lets me select some representative files to show the next class. It helps explain these newer projects to the next class. 

And, it's good for you to organize your stuff.

## Where?

Server?
