# Closing Thoughts

> Keep the vision in mind. Keep trying and failing. You will get stuck. It won’t be quick, but over time you’ll get better and better at coding. Keep persevering and don’t give up. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Don’t be afraid to ask “dumb questions” — there are no dumb questions.

## Why focus on process?

For a small website, maybe it doesn't matter as much, but of course, a lot of websites are much larger. Someday, you might spend 200 hours or more on a project as part of a team. If there are problems with the process, it can get painful. It's worth the work to align a team on process.

## Enough or too much code?

It's pretty clear to me that to get anyone fully proficient in any coding language would take at least a semester focused on that one thing. Instead, we stayed focused on where _code intersects with design_, and that's CSS. I hope that you feel that the bar to entry if you want to pursue further learning, was at least lowered significantly by this class.

**Remember, you might only understand 20% of CSS and HTML and still make a website that works.** It's totally okay to copy the code, hack something together, and put it out there, even if you don't understand every aspect.

I do think I _overdid the lectures_ this time. When focusing on **more exercises** might have been more useful and practical.

## Codecademy? Any good?

Let me know what you thought of Codecademy. I have mixed feelings, but I want to know if you felt it helped you at all.

<!-- GitHub (and Git version control), Gulp, Node were an attempt to introduce you to current industry standards. -->

## Do you even want to?

New jobs won't expect you to know everything. You may be forced to learn more code, but if you don't like it, you'll eventually drift out of that position. It's all okay.

If you do like it and want to learn more, there's a wealth of resources out there. If you keep at it, you may find yourself drifting into a more technical job.

<!-- ## Was it a mess?

I think so. Thanks for not complaining too much.

I know you would _feel _ better having more finished work... but, I haven't quite solved how to synthesize all of the different things into full site projects, and fit it into a semester.

I think a cursory introduction to a bunch of things has value, but would a deeper dive into responsive and **user-interface** design be beneficial, even if it meant less coding? I feel like we didn't hit on the UI part enough...

On the other hand, many of your forays into prototyping have been very successful. As software options improve, I think some of you will find this becoming a larger part of your future jobs. -->

## On design

However conflicted I feel about teaching code, I feel like the design portion of this class was pretty successful. Is there something you think is missing I should try to hit on another time?

<!-- ## Demonstrations

Useful to watch me struggle...or would you prefer more planned out? What about a full website coding demo, over the whole semester, 20 minutes every class? -->

## Ideas for next year?

<!-- *   **More smaller projects**, or even **less larger ones**?
    *   One full website project, whole semester, with milestones for grading and critiquing along the way?
*   Lectures coincide with projects closer.
*   Atom telesync or CodePen Instructor mode so code is on students screen rather than a projector.
*   Cover Links
*   Cover Video Embeds -->
